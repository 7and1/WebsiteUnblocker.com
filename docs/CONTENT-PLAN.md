# How to Unblock [Website] in 2026

**Quick Answer**: The fastest way to unblock [Website] is with a VPN. Connect to a server where [Website] is available, and you'll have instant access. [NordVPN](affiliate-link) works best for this.

[Website] is blocked in [list countries/situations]. Whether you're at school, work, or in a country with restrictions, this guide shows you exactly how to get access.

**In this guide:**
- Why [Website] is blocked
- 3 methods to unblock it
- Which VPN works best
- Common issues and fixes

---

## Why Is [Website] Blocked?

[Website] gets blocked for several reasons:

**Government Censorship**
Countries like China, Russia, and Iran block [Website] to control information. They use national firewalls to prevent access.

**School and Work Networks**
IT administrators block [Website] to reduce distractions. These blocks use URL filters and firewall rules.

**Geo-Restrictions**
[Website] may limit content by region due to licensing deals. You see different content based on your IP address.

**ISP Blocks**
Some internet providers block [Website] due to legal requirements or network policies.

---

## Method 1: Use a VPN (Recommended)

A VPN is the most reliable way to unblock [Website]. It encrypts your traffic and routes it through a server in another location.

**How it works:**
1. Download a VPN app
2. Connect to a server where [Website] works
3. Open [Website] normally

**Best VPNs for [Website]:**

| VPN | Speed | Servers | Price | Best For |
|-----|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| NordVPN | Fast | 5,500+ | $3.99/mo | Overall best |
| ExpressVPN | Very Fast | 3,000+ | $6.67/mo | Streaming |
| Surfshark | Fast | 3,200+ | $2.49/mo | Budget pick |

**[CTA Button: Get NordVPN 67% Off]**

**Step-by-step setup:**

1. Go to [NordVPN.com](affiliate-link)
2. Choose a plan (2-year is cheapest)
3. Download the app for your device
4. Log in and connect to [recommended server location]
5. Open [Website] - you now have access

---

## Method 2: Use a Web Proxy

A web proxy routes your traffic through another server. It's free but has serious downsides.

**How to use:**
1. Go to a proxy site (hide.me, proxysite.com)
2. Enter [Website] URL
3. Browse through the proxy

**Why we don't recommend it:**
- Slow speeds
- No encryption (not secure)
- Many proxies are blocked
- Can't handle video streaming well
- Some inject ads or malware

Use this only if you need quick access and don't care about security.

---

## Method 3: Use Tor Browser

Tor bounces your traffic through multiple servers worldwide. It's free and anonymous but very slow.

**How to use:**
1. Download Tor Browser from torproject.org
2. Open it and wait for connection
3. Navigate to [Website]

**Downsides:**
- Extremely slow (not usable for video)
- Some sites block Tor
- Can draw attention in some countries

---

## FAQ

### Is it legal to unblock [Website]?

Using a VPN is legal in most countries. However, check local laws. Some countries restrict VPN use.

### Why is my VPN not unblocking [Website]?

Try these fixes:
- Switch to a different server
- Clear your browser cache
- Disable WebRTC in browser settings
- Contact VPN support

### Which free VPN works for [Website]?

Free VPNs usually don't work. They have slow speeds, data limits, and [Website] often blocks them. A paid VPN costs less than a coffee and actually works.

### Can my school/work see I'm using a VPN?

They can see VPN traffic but not what you're doing. Use obfuscated servers (NordVPN has these) to hide VPN use completely.

### Will a VPN slow down [Website]?

Good VPNs have minimal speed loss (5-10%). Cheap or free VPNs can slow you down significantly.

---

## Conclusion

The fastest and safest way to unblock [Website] is with a VPN. We recommend NordVPN for its speed, reliability, and strong security.
